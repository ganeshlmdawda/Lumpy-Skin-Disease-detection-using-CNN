# Lumpy-Skin-Disease-detection-using-CNN
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect Lumpy Skin Disease in cows from images. It provides a web interface built with Flask, allowing users to upload images and get predictions on whether a cow is affected by Lumpy Skin Disease or not.

**Features**
- Image Upload: Users can upload images of cows through a web interface.
- Disease Detection: The CNN model analyzes the uploaded image to detect signs of Lumpy Skin Disease.
- Result Display: The result indicating whether the cow is affected by the disease or not is displayed to the user.

**Technology Stack**
- Python: Core programming language.
- Flask: Web framework used to create the web interface.
- TensorFlow/Keras: Libraries used to build and train the CNN model.
- OpenCV: Library used for image processing.
- Matplotlib: Library used for plotting model performance and results.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for training and testing the Lumpy Skin Disease detection model is a combination of images sourced from Kaggle and additional images collected from veterinary doctors. This diverse dataset helps improve the model's accuracy and robustness in detecting Lumpy Skin Disease in cows.

**Sources**
**Kaggle Dataset:**
A portion of the images in the dataset were sourced from a publicly available dataset on Kaggle. These images primarily include labeled examples of cows with and without Lumpy Skin Disease.

**Collected Images:**
Additional images were collected from veterinary doctors. These images provide more variety and real-world examples, enhancing the dataset's diversity and the model's ability to generalize to new data.
The collected images include high-resolution photos taken in various conditions, ensuring a wide range of scenarios for model training.

**Data Structure**
The dataset is organized into two main categories:
**Lumpy Skin:** Images of cows affected by Lumpy Skin Disease.
**Healthy Skin:** Images of healthy cows without any signs of Lumpy Skin Disease.
