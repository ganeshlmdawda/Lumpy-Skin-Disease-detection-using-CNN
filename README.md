# Lumpy-Skin-Disease-detection-using-CNN
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect Lumpy Skin Disease in cows from images. It provides a web interface built with Flask, allowing users to upload images and get predictions on whether a cow is affected by Lumpy Skin Disease or not.

**Features**
- Image Upload: Users can upload images of cows through a web interface.
- Disease Detection: The CNN model analyzes the uploaded image to detect signs of Lumpy Skin Disease.
- Result Display: The result indicating whether the cow is affected by the disease or not is displayed to the user.

**Technology Stack**
- Python: Core programming language.
- Flask: Web framework used to create the web interface.
- TensorFlow/Keras: Libraries used to build and train the CNN model.
- OpenCV: Library used for image processing.
- Matplotlib: Library used for plotting model performance and results.
